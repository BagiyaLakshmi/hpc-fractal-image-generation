### Introduction
The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that is generated by iterating a simple function on the points of the complex plane. The points that produce a cycle (the same value over and over again) fall in the set, whereas the points that diverge (give ever-growing values) lie outside it. Genrating these high quality images takes a lot of time and memory when done sequentially. So we find a way to implement this genration in parallel.


### Features
The Mandelbrot set calculation is parallelized by dividing the image into rows and assigning each thread a subset of rows to compute concurrently. Each thread computes the Mandelbrot set for its assigned rows independently, which enables parallel processing.
The parallelization is achieved by creating multiple threads (equal to the hardware concurrency level) and distributing the workload among them, allowing for faster computation compared to a single-threadedÂ approach.


### How to run?
#### MPI
```
mpicxx -o mandelbrot_mpi mpi_frac.cpp
```
```
mpirun -np 4 ./mandelbrot_mpi
```

#### Parallel

```
g++ -o mandelbrot_parallel parallel_frac.cpp -std=c++11 pthread
```

```
./mandelbrot_parallel
```

#### Sequential

```
g++ -o mandelbrot seq_frac.cpp
```
```
./mandelbrot
```
